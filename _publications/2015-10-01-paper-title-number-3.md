excerpt: 'Light  field  saliency  detection—important  due  to  utility  in  many  vision  tasks—still  lacks  speed  and  can improve in accuracy. Due to the formulation of the saliency detection problem in light fields as a segmentation task  or  a  memorizing  task,  existing  approaches  consume  unnecessarily  large  amounts  of  computational resources for training, and have longer execution times for testing.  We solve this by aggressively reducing the large light field images to a much smaller three-channel feature map appropriate for saliency detection using an RGB image saliency detector with attention mechanisms.  We achieve this by introducing a novel convolutional neural network based features extraction and encoding module.  Our saliency detector takes 0.4 s to process a light field of size 9×9×512×375 in a CPU and is significantly faster than state-of-the-art light field saliency detectors, with better or comparable accuracy.  Furthermore, model size of our architecture is significantly lower compared to state-of-the-art light field saliency detectors.  Our work showsthat  extracting  features  from  light  fields  through  aggressive  size  reduction  and  the  attention  mechanism results in a faster and accurate light field saliency detector leading to near real-time light field processing.'
