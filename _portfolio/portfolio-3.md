title: "Traffic Sign, Traffic Light and Static Object Detection for Self-driving. "
excerpt: "We developed traffic sign, traffic light, lane and road marking detection algorithms suitable for chaotic and
unstructured road scenarios in Sri Lanka and created the first large datasets for traffic sign, traffic light, and road marking detection for Sri Lanka, containing
unique challenges in a developing country with scenarios covering traffic, rain, dazzle light, and normal conditions. Our row-wise classification-based lane marking detection algorithm which outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of speed with comparable and better F1 values and the end-system was optimized for real-time performance in Nvidia-Jetson Xavier with ROS.You can check the video of the final system here [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52EOxkSEivg).<br/><img src='/images/FYP.gif' style='width:50%'>"
