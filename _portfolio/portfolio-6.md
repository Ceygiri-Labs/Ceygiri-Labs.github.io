title: "Custom Application Processor for Image Downsampling"
excerpt: "Designed an application specific processor with a custom ISA for processing RGB images using DE2-115 development board. Final processor could downsample an image by an integer factor up to 15 using Gaussian and average filtering and it could apply any linear separable filter to images.UART transceiver, developed using Verilog was used as the communication medium between the processor and the PC.
