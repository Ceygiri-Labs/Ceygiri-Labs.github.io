title: "Custom Application Processor for Image Downsampling"
excerpt: "Designed an application specific processor with a custom ISA for processing RGB images using DE2-115 development board.<br/> Final processor could downsample an image by an integer factor up to 15 using Gaussian and average filtering and it could apply any linear separable filter to images.<br/> UART transceiver, developed using Verilog was used as the communication medium between the processor and the PC. You can check the report and the code [here](https://github.com/sahanHe/Custom-processor-for-image-down-sampling).<br/><img src='/images/datapath.png' style='width:50%'>"
