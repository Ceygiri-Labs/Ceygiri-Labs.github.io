title: "Light Field Saliency Detetion"
excerpt: "Visual perception can be regarded as one of the main components in understanding thesurrounding environment of a self-driving car.  Detection of static regulatory and naviga-tional objects which include traffic signs,  traffic lights,  lanes and road markings can beidentified as a pivotal task in such systems.  It is essential for these detection frameworksto  be  robust  and  perform  accurately  in  challenging  road  scenarios  in  real-time.   Cater-ing to this requirement is a challenging task due to the trade-off between accuracy andspeed in modern deep learning based approaches.  Our focus is on developing robust de-tection algorithms for the aforementioned static objects to be implemented in real-time ina resource-constrained environment to facilitate self-driving.We  have  developed  three  separate  detection  frameworks  for  traffic  signs  and  trafficlights, lanes and road markings.  Our traffic sign and traffic light detection pipeline con-stitutes a state-of-the-art object detector model to detect the superclass of each traffic signand traffic light and a separate classifier model to individually recognize each class.  Forthe lane detection task, we propose a lightweight, end-to-end deep learning based networkarchitecture,  for fast and efficient lane detection.  This framework is supplemented withtwo post-processing techniques to further increase the accuracy. Our detection pipeline forroad markings includes extracting the road area through inverse perspective transform andemploying a state-of-the-art object detector model to detect the road markings in each im-age.  Simultaneously, we have created two benchmark datasets in the Sri Lankan context,one for traffic signs and traffic lights, and the other for road markings in order to ensurethe robustness of our algorithms for the Sri Lankan road and traffic scenarios.  We use thepublicly available CULane dataset for the experiments carried out on lane detection.The trained detection models are optimized through TensorRT conversion and quanti-zation for the implementation on an Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier as the embedded system.The optimized models are integrated together to produce a complete Robot Operating Sys-tem package, which visualizes the detection results and publishes them through ROS topicsin real-time.  Our static object detection system performs well for the Sri Lankan contextboth in terms of speed and accuracy as comprehensively presented in the qualitative andquantitative results.<br/><video width="320" height="240" controls src='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52EOxkSEivg'>"
